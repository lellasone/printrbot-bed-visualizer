'''! 
    This script repeatedly height-probes a 3D printer's bed and generates a
    heat map of how far each probe height is from the lowest probe point found. 
    The script will repeatedly release and re-aquire ownership of the commport,
    so this most likely will not work with programs like cura running.
      
    The default settings are largely suitable for a printerbot simple metal,
    but the script should work for most printers with a height probe given the
    proper arguments.   

    args:
        -v, verbose:      sets the script to output more internal details. 
        -l, leveling:     sets the script to run in G29 compatablility mode. 
        -m, modern_marlin sets compatability for modernmarlin firmware. 
        -b, baud=:        sets the serial buad rate. 
        -p, port=:        sets the comport. 
        -x, x_limit=:     how large an area in x to probe over. 
        -y, y_limit=:     how large an area in y to probe over. 
        -s, step=:        how far in each axis to move between probings.
